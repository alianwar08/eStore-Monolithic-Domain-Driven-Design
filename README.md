**Monolithic eCommerce application with domain driven design principles
**

**Applied Domain-Driven Design (DDD**)
As I began my journey learning Domain-Driven Design, I encountered a significant amount of theory presented by Eric Evans in a clear and comprehensive manner. As a software engineer, I sought to supplement my understanding with code examples, but found limited resources in this area for C#.

In response, I have decided to publish sample project in C# with the aim of making Domain-Driven Design more approachable and easier to follow. It will serve as my attempt to simplify the subject for others who, like me, are eager to see practical examples. This is an ongoing project and I will get better with time.


**Repository objective:** To supplement blog articles on DDD (see below) and create easy to follow Domain-driven design repository that makes sense (if it still makes no sense then please do let me know).

Please do note that this is my interpretation of Domain-driven design (i.e. biased). Please use this for theoretical / educational purposes only.


A monolithic eCommerce application built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles that follow a layered architecture, with the following components:

**Domain Layer:** This is the core of the application and contains the domain entities, value objects, services, and repositories that represent the business domain.

**Application Layer: ** This layer contains the application services that coordinate the use of the domain model. It acts as an intermediary between the domain layer and the infrastructure layer.

**Infrastructure Layer:** This layer contains the implementation of the repositories and services that interact with the database and other external systems, such as payment gateways.

**API Layer: ** This layer contains the API interface and logic. It communicates with the application layer to request and display data from the domain model.

The monolithic application would have a single codebase, a single database, and a single deployment unit. 

In a DDD-based eCommerce application, the focus would be on the domain model and its interactions with the rest of the system. The domain model would be rich and expressive, capturing the business requirements and the core business logic of the eCommerce application.

The domain model can be tested in isolation, without having to access the database or any other external system. This makes the application easier to test, understand, and maintain, as well as helping to ensure that the business logic remains decoupled from the infrastructure.

The application would be designed with scalability and maintainability in mind, making use of well-established patterns and practices. The application would also be designed to evolve over time, making it easier to add new features and capabilities as the business grows.
